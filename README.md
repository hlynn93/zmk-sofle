# Overview

Sofle keyboard but, keymappings are configured to work without the need of the top number rows so that the fingers do not need to move away from the home rows and easier to transition into smaller keyboards such as corne without having to retrain the muscle memory. Only the middle 3 keys of the thumb rows from each side are actually used. *Right shift* should ideally be replaced with the *media* key beside but I need it for the setup at work.
